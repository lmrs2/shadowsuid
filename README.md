The repository conatins the following files:

Execute without paramteres to print the usage.

### extract_signature.py

Extract file signature.

### interpreter_dummy.c

An example of a tiny possible interpreter for shadow suid.

Compile using: `gcc interpreter_dummy.c -o interpreter`


### interpreter_final.c

An example of an interpreter which doesn't interfere with the original suid executed.
